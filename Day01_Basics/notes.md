# Day 01 – Introduction to Python 🐍 

## What is Python?

# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
# It’s simple, readable, and great for beginners.

# You can use Python for:

- Web development (Flask, Django)

- Data science and machine learning (Pandas, TensorFlow)

- Automation and scripts

- App development

### High-level: easy to understand, close to human language.
### Interpreted: runs code line by line — no need to compile.

# What does “Dynamically Typed” mean?🧠 

In Python, you don’t need to declare the data type of a variable.
Python automatically decides the type when you assign a value.

# Why is Python popular?

🧠 Easy to learn and understand

💬 Big community and lots of libraries

💪 Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

🔄 Used in many fields like web, data, and AI

🔹 What is an IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) helps you write, run, and test your code easily.
It provides auto-suggestions, syntax highlighting, and a run button.

Examples:

- VS Code – lightweight and simple

- PyCharm – best for big projects

- Jupyter Lab – great for data science and learning

💡 I use Jupyter Lab because I can write code, see results, and take notes in one place.

## How Python Runs Code

Python is an interpreted language, which means it executes code line by line.

✅ Advantages:

- Easier to find and fix errors

- You can test small parts of code quickly

- Faster for beginners to learn and practice

## Disadvantage:

- Runs slower than compiled languages because each line is checked and executed one by one

## Compiler (short note):
- A compiler translates the entire program into machine code before running it, which makes execution faster — languages like C and Java use compilers.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
## Key Features of Python

- Simple and clean syntax

- Interpreted language

- Dynamically typed

- Object-oriented

- Has many built-in libraries
