### Day 01 – Introduction to Python 🐍

# What is Python? 🔹 
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
It’s simple, readable, and great for beginners.

You can use Python for:

-  Web development (Flask, Django)

-  Data science and machine learning (Pandas, TensorFlow)

-  Automation and scripts

-  App development

## High-level: easy to understand, close to human language.
## Interpreted: runs code line by line — no need to compile.

 # Why is Python popular? 🔹

🧠 Easy to learn and understand

💬 Big community and lots of libraries

💪 Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

🔄 Used in many fields like web, data, and AI

🔹 What is an IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) helps you write, run, and test your code easily.
It provides auto-suggestions, syntax highlighting, and a run button.

Examples:

-  VS Code – lightweight and simple

-  PyCharm – best for big projects

-  Jupyter Lab – great for data science and learning

💡 I use Jupyter Lab because I can write code, see results, and take notes in one place.

  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```

  

 ## Key Features of Python 🔹

- Simple and clean syntax

- Interpreted language

- Dynamically typed

- Object-oriented

- Has many built-in libraries
